## Inspiration
Don't get us wrong, there's many good things about our country, the West, and principles that guide our lives. But we set out on this project because we noticed an unfairness in the world. We noticed that things that bring Goodness in the world, the actions that so many of us undertake on a daily basis, often go under-rewarded, far more than they ought to be.  
  
Our project today aimed to bring awareness to those littler actions, to bring notice and measure to the way people live their lives and encourage people to do better. We wanted to build an app that quantifies every individual's contributions to our planet and encourages them to do more. Goodness crosses this hurdle, also solving the long-standing issue of finding it hard to wrap our heads around how we, the individual, might be contributing to the big issues such as climate change and global warming. We wanted to provide an app that brings forward this information directly to the user.

## What it does
We built a one-stop platform for users to measure their impact on the big issues such as environmental impact. Users answer simple questions about their own lifestyle to begin, or simply link their known social media accounts. We traverse this information and make predictions about their lifestyle, giving a score on users' environmental impact. We don't do this unashamedly - most of us live in heavy, metropolitan municipalities, totally dependent on the brutally hyper-efficient, human-focused, modern service industry. Most users of our app are net beneficiaries of the resources our planet provides. First we make people aware of this by giving people a score relating to their carbon footprint. Then, we offer suggestions and progression paths to turn those beneficiaries into contributors.

## How we built it
We divided the project into clear-cut subsections to work on. We identified a strong front-end GUI component, which we chose to build with ReactJS. The back-end would require an sqlite3 database supported by a RESTful API written in GoLang. We used these tools to research data from appropriate environmental services, including a in-depth study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, and generated database values for our product.

## Challenges we ran into
We were ideally seeking to integrate the product with the Facebook API with features for parsing post history data to instantly obtain values on lifestyle data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Functioning product that works as a website on both desktop and mobile. Dynamic values that are personalised to each user answering questions on themselves. Informed data on one's environmental impact in a persistent state that can be revisited and improved upon.

## What we learned
Personally furthered our individual expertise in these languages. Explored unique APIs such as OpenBank. Examined a range of approaches to try and obtain and handle unique data, such as one's lifestyle patterns.
